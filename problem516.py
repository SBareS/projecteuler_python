5-smooth totients
5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.
5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.
Let S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's
totient function Ï†(n) is a Hamming number.
S(100)=3728.

Find $S(10^{12})$. Give your answer modulo $2^{32}$.
