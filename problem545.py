Faulhaber's Formulas
The sum of the kth powers of the first n positive integers can be expressed as
a polynomial of degree k+1 with rational coefficients, the Faulhaber's 
Formulas: 1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k = a1*n + a2*n^2 + ... + ak n^k + a(k+1)n^(k+1),
where ai's are rational coefficients that can be written as reduced fractions
pi/qi (if ai = 0, we shall consider qi=1).

For example, 1^4 + 2^4 + ... + n^4 = -1/30 n + 1/3 n^3 + 1/2 n^4 + 1/5 n^5.
Define D(k) as the value of q1 for the sum of kth powers (i.e. the denominator
of the reduced fraction a1).
Define as F(m) the mth value of k >= 1 for which D(k) = 20010.
You are given D(4) = 30 (since a1 = -1/30), D(308) = 20010, F(1) = 308, F(10) = 96404.
